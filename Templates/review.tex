  Review of [insert title] by [insert author]
\end{center}


Provide a summary of the what the paper is about and how you feel about its 
credibility. Refer to Note 7 on the HuskyCT STAT4916W course website for 
guidelines and tips.


My major and minor concerns are listed below.\\

\noindent Major concerns:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Insert major concern 1 here.

\item Insert major concern 2 here.

\item Use the major comments to identify specific (major) points that are not 
clearly presented or need to be improved, in the order that they appeared in 
the paper. Indicate page numbers, line numbers, section numbers, etc.  
of the issues that you raise, e.g.,

\item Page 2, line 18: It is stated that ``Another author proposes a solution
that disentangles the parameters of interest using limited data'' but then later
in line 27 you appear to contradict yourself by stating ``the limited data is not 
fit for our purpose.''  Can you please clarify?

\item Pages 3-4, Section 2: Given that a key aspect of the paper is data 
visualization, one way to improve the paper would be to include more graphical
displays.  More specifically, images that are more exciting and tell a stronger
story about the data would be useful in Section 2. 

\item $\ldots$

\end{enumerate}


\noindent Minor concerns:

\begin{itemize}

\item Insert minor comment 1 here.

\item Insert minor comment 2 here. 

\item Use these minor comments to note small, nonconceptual issues (misprints, 
typos, notation abuse, grammar issues, etc.).  Also indicate page numbers 
and line numbers of the issues that you raise, potentially quoting text 
from the paper.  E.g.,] 

\item Page 3, lines 18-20: What is meant by ``As we collected data, we 
periodically discarded entries that did not have location data and contain
one of our attributes of interest.''  Does ``not''  modify both clauses?

\item Page 7, line 5: Change ``was'' to ``were'' in ``The data was collected 
$\ldots$''.

\item $\ldots$
